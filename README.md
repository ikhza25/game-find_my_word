## About
"Find My Word" is a simple game where players are asked to find specific words within a grid of characters. Although simple in concept, this game challenges players to input answers based on the words present in the grid. Consisting of five levels with different themes, ranging from school-related words, city names, island names, fruits, to animal names, "Find My Word" offers an interactive and engaging playing experience. Python was chosen as the primary language for developing this game due to its ease of use and its extensive support for modules for developing graphical and interactive applications.
